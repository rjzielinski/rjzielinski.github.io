  abstract = {Background In Parkinson's disease (PD), gait and balance is impaired, relatively resistant to available treatment and associated with falls and disability. Predictive models of ambulatory progression could enhance understanding of gait/balance disturbances and aid in trial design. Objectives To predict trajectories of ambulatory abilities from baseline clinical data in early PD, relate trajectories to clinical milestones, compare biomarkers, and evaluate trajectories for enrichment of clinical trials. Methods Data from two multicenter, longitudinal, observational studies were used for model training (Tracking Parkinson's, n = 1598) and external testing (Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative, n = 407). Models were trained and validated to predict individuals as having a “Progressive” or “Stable” trajectory based on changes of ambulatory capacity scores from the Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale parts II and III. Survival analyses compared time-to-clinical milestones and trial outcomes between predicted trajectories. Results On external evaluation, a support vector machine model predicted Progressive trajectories using baseline clinical data with an accuracy, weighted-F1 (proportionally weighted harmonic mean of precision and sensitivity), and sensitivity/specificity of 0.735, 0.799, and 0.688/0.739, respectively. Over 4 years, the predicted Progressive trajectory was more likely to experience impaired balance, loss of independence, impaired function and cognition. Baseline dopamine transporter imaging and select biomarkers of neurodegeneration were significantly different between predicted trajectory groups. For an 18-month, randomized (1:1) clinical trial, sample size savings up to 30\% were possible when enrollment was enriched for the Progressive trajectory versus no enrichment. Conclusions It is possible to predict ambulatory abilities from clinical data that are associated with meaningful outcomes in people with early PD. © 2023 The Authors.

  abstract = {One of the promising opportunities of digital health is its potential to lead to more holistic understandings of diseases by interacting with the daily life of patients and through the collection of large amounts of real-world data. Validating and benchmarking indicators of disease severity in the home setting is difficult, however, given the large number of confounders present in the real world and the challenges in collecting ground truth data in the home. Here we leverage two datasets collected from patients with Parkinson’s disease, which couples continuous wrist-worn accelerometer data with frequent symptom reports in the home setting, to develop digital biomarkers of symptom severity. Using these data, we performed a public benchmarking challenge in which participants were asked to build measures of severity across 3 symptoms (on/off medication, dyskinesia, and tremor). 42 teams participated and performance was improved over baseline models for each subchallenge. Additional ensemble modeling across submissions further improved performance, and the top models validated in a subset of patients whose symptoms were observed and rated by trained clinicians.},

  abstract = {Longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging data is used to model trajectories of change in brain regions of interest to identify areas susceptible to atrophy in those with neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimer's disease. Most methods for extracting brain regions are applied to scans from study participants independently, resulting in wide variability in shape and volume estimates of these regions over time in longitudinal studies. To address this problem, we propose a longitudinal principal manifold estimation method, which seeks to recover smooth, longitudinally meaningful manifold estimates of shapes over time. The proposed approach uses a smoothing spline to smooth over the coefficients of principal manifold embedding functions estimated at each time point. This mitigates the effects of random disturbances to the manifold between time points. Additionally, we propose a novel data augmentation approach to enable principal manifold estimation on self-intersecting manifolds. Simulation studies demonstrate performance improvements over naive applications of principal manifold estimation and principal curve/surface methods. The proposed method improves the estimation of surfaces of hippocampuses and thalamuses using data from participants of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. An analysis of magnetic resonance imaging data from 236 individuals shows the advantages of our proposed methods that leverage regional longitudinal trends for segmentation.},
