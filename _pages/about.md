I am a 4th-year student in the Biostatistics PhD program at Brown University, where I am advised by Ani Eloyan. My research focuses on developing manifold learning methods to estimate low-dimensional representations underlying neuroimaging data. We hope to use this information to better understand the neurological changes caused by Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative conditions.

Prior to my time at Brown, I graduated from Amherst College with a degree in Statistics and Economics, and I worked as a bioinformaticist at the University of Rochester's Center for Health + Technology.
